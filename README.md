## Data collection

Phenotypic, metadata, agronomic information are released to public every year since 2014. These data sets have their own year-specific data identifier (DOI) and are available in the G2F repository at [https://www.genomes2fields.org/resources](https://www.genomes2fields.org/resources/).

Genotypic SNP data for years 2014-2022 can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.25739/tq5e-ak26](https://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/commons_repo/curated/GenomesToFields_GenotypeByEnvironment_PredictionCompetition_2023)


## Data curation and environmental covariates derivation
A modular code workflow as below was used to clean phenotypic and genotypic data, and to develop environmental covariates (EC) derived from crop modeling.
This workflow can be found in this [wiki](https://github.com/QuantGen/MAIZE-HUB/wiki/Pipeline-data-curation)
