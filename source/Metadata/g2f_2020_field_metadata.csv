At first I thought it was a 'tripping' error on my behalf but it is very even and throughout the field, so I consulted Wallace about it. 

Wallace and I took a look at it together on 6/17/2020 and think it may be due to how the planter/tractor was calibrated that day. We had expected the planting density to be enough to evenly
fill a plot 20 ft long (and the tractor tire marks are for 20ft long plots), but it seems that the planting  density is only enough to evenly fill about 16.5 ft of each plot. Thus  there is about a 3.5 ft gap at the 'end' of each plot, with the end  being relative to the direction we planted in.""","There is no back border on G2F; plots 1-545, 1-546, 1-547, 1-548, 1-549, 1-550 are all exposed, without a border buffer for protection.",The front border for G2F was planted in the grass; ie didn't offer a lot of protection,"With the corn already dried yet late to be harvested, some late season storms came through and caused a large amount of lodging throughout the field.
